# EntreFox Health Condition Survey Form (Terveyskunnon kehitt√§misen kysely)

Project is under construction!

The projects goal is to recreate and redesign a health condition survey form for EntreFox. This survey will be integrated in EntreFox's website, which will replace the old survey made with Google Forms. The necessary features include a survey with EntreFox's theme as well as more detailed summary at the end of the survey.

This project is reusing the theme, components and majority of code from previously created surveys, found [here](https://github.com/didzis1/entrefox-form) and [here](https://github.com/didzis1/entrefox-time-mngmt-form).
